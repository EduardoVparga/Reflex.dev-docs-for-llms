# Python Package Index

In order to publish a Python package, you need to use a publishing utility. Any would work, but we recommend either [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/#publishing-your-package).

# PyPI

It is straightforward to create accounts and API tokens with PyPI. There is official help on the [PyPI website](https://pypi.org/help/). For a quick reference here, go to the top right corner of the PyPI website and look for the button to register and fill out personal information.

A user can use username and password to authenticate with PyPI when publishing.

Scroll down to the API tokens section and click on the "Add API token" button. Fill out the form and click "Generate API token".
