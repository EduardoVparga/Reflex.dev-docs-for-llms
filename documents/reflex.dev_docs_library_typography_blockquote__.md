# Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the blockquote. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacingâ€”as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="1"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="2"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="3"),

    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="8"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="9"),
)
```

# Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the blockquote weight.

## Examples

```python
rx.flex(
    rx.blockquote(
        "Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.",
        weight="light",
    ),
    rx.blockquote(
        "Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.",
        weight="regular",
    ),
    rx.blockquote(
        "Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.",
        weight="medium",
    ),
    rx.blockquote(
        "Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.",
        weight="bold",
    ),
)
```
