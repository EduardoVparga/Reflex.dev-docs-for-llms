# Introduction

Reflex is an open-source framework for quickly building beautiful, interactive web applications in pure Python.

[Learn more](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/#goals)

# Goals

* Pure Python
  * Use Python for everything. Don't worry about learning a new language.
* Easy to Learn
  * Build and share your first app in minutes. No web development experience required.
* Full Flexibility
  * Remain as flexible as traditional web frameworks. Reflex is easy to use, yet allows for advanced use cases.
  * Build anything from small data science apps to large, multi-page websites. This entire site was built and deployed with Reflex!
* Batteries Included
  * No need to reach for a bunch of different tools. Reflex handles the user interface, server-side logic, and deployment of your app.

# An example: Make it count

Here, we go over a simple counter app that lets the user count up or down.

<div class="rt-Box flex flex-col p-6 rounded-xl overflow-x-auto border border-slate-4 bg-slate-2 items-center justify-center w-full">
  <div class="rt-Flex rt-r-fd-row rt-r-ai-start rt-r-gap-4 rx-Stack css-zcxndt">
    <button class="rt-reset rt-BaseButton rt-r-size-2 rt-variant-solid rt-Button" data-accent-color="ruby">Decrement</button>
  </div>
</div>

# 0

<button>Increment</button>

Here is the full code for this example:

*Frontend*

The frontend is built declaratively using Reflex components. Components are compiled down to JS and served to the users browser, therefore:
- Only use Reflex components, vars, and var operations when building your UI. Any other logic should be put in your `State` (backend).
- Use `rx.cond` and `rx.foreach` (replaces if statements and for loops), for creating dynamic UIs.

```python
import reflex as rx

class State(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1


def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.button("Decrement", color_scheme="ruby", on_click=State.decrement),
        rx.heading(State.count, font_size="2em"),
        rx.button("Increment", color_scheme="grass", on_click=State.increment),
        spacing="4"
    )

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

# The Structure of a Reflex App

Let's break this example down.

[Import](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/#import)

# Import

We begin by importing the `reflex` package (aliased to `rx`). We reference Reflex objects as `rx.*` by convention.

```python
import reflex as rx
```

We begin by importing the `reflex` package (aliased to `rx`). We reference Reflex objects as `rx.*` by convention.

# State

The state defines all the variables (called **vars**) in an app that can change, as well as the functions (called **event_handlers**) that change them.

Here our state has a single var, `count`, which holds the current value of the counter. We initialize it to `0`.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
```

The state defines all the variables (called **vars**) in an app that can change, as well as the functions (called **event_handlers**) that change them.

Here our state has a single var, `count`, which holds the current value of the counter. We initialize it to `0`.

# Event Handlers

Within the state, we define functions, called **event handlers**, that change the state vars.

Event handlers are the only way that we can modify the state in Reflex. They can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. These actions are called **events**.

Our counter app has two event handlers, `increment` and `decrement`.

[Learn more about user interface (UI) in Reflex](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/#user-interface-(ui))

# User Interface (UI)

This function defines the app's user interface.

We use different components such as `rx.hstack`, `rx.button`, and `rx.heading` to build the frontend. Components can be nested to create complex layouts, and can be styled using the full power of CSS.

Reflex comes with 50+ built-in components to help you get started.
We are actively adding more components. Also, it's easy to wrap your own React components.

```python
rx.hstack(
    rx.button("Decrement", color_scheme="ruby", on_click=State.decrement),
    rx.heading(State.count, font_size="2em"),
    rx.button("Increment", color_scheme="grass", on_click=State.increment),
    spacing="4"
)
```

Components can reference the app's state vars.
The `rx.heading` component displays the current value of the counter by referencing `State.count`.
All components that reference state will reactively update whenever the state changes.

```python
rx.button(
    "Decrement",
    color_scheme="ruby",
    on_click=State.decrement,
)
```

Components interact with the state by binding events triggers to event handlers.
For example, `on_click` is an event that is triggered when a user clicks a component.

The first button in our app binds its `on_click` event to the `State.decrement` event handler. Similarly the second button binds `on_click` to `State.increment`.

In other words, the sequence goes like this:

- User clicks "increment" on the UI.
- `on_click` event is triggered.
- Event handler `State.increment` is called.
- `State.count` is incremented.
- UI updates to reflect the new value of `State.count`.

# Add pages

Next we define our app and add the counter component to the base route.

```python
app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```
